Resource pack for the Prosperity server. The goal of this pack is to give players the ability to create vanilla item variations that can be applied through the server resource pack.

## Use

Download the resource pack from the [releases](https://github.com/ProsperityMC/Prosperity-Resource-Pack/releases). 

You can also build manually or with [ResourcePacker](https://github.com/nixinova/resourcepacker) by running `rpkr pack` in the terminal.

To apply `CustomModelData` in game you can use the [Custom Roleplay Data](minecraft/customization/custom-roleplay-data-datapack) datapack.

## Contribute

If you wish to add textures you can let me know in Discord, or create a pull request for this repository. Please follow these guidelines when contributing:

- Do not overwrite vanilla textures directly
- No NSFW content
- No religious symbolism
- No real brands / logos

### Limitations

Unfortunately the `CustomModelData` feature is quite limited and can only be applied to maps, pumpkins, and handheld items.
