Resource pack for the Prosperity server. The goal of this pack is to give players the ability to create vanilla item variations that can be applied through the server resource pack.

## Use

Download the resource pack from the [releases](https://github.com/ProsperityMC/Prosperity-Resource-Pack/releases).

You can also build manually or with [ResourcePacker](https://github.com/nixinova/resourcepacker) by running `rpkr pack` in the terminal.

To apply `CustomModelData` in game you can use the [Custom Roleplay Data](minecraft/customization/custom-roleplay-data-datapack) datapack.
